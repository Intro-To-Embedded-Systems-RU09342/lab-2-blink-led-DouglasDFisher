This project is a simple blink of two LEDs. It does this by toggling the outputs of both LEDs, and then in the for loop delay, toggling the output of the second LED. This gives the two LEDs a frequency of 1:2.

The difference between the codes is you have to disable the high impedance state for the FR6989.
